# AMuseGame

A simple side-scroller controlled with your mind.

This game uses the Muse headband to detect blinks and head movements in order to control a 2D character. Blinking causes the character to jump and moving the user's head down causes the character to duck. 

## Install Instructions

Prerequisites:
Muse headband
Node.js
Bluetooth compatibility

a) Unzip the contents of the file. 
b) Pair your Muse headband to the computer/phone.
c) Once it is paired, double-click the file "StartGame.bat"
d) Once the command prompt says "Succesfully connected to the Muse!", open localhost:8080 in your browser to start the game

It would be too many files to upload if we added the node modules you need to install, but all you need is:

1. node-muse
2. socket.io
3. express

and you're good to go!
